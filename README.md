WALKTHROUGH :

- Go to the old house and pick up the potion, drink it right away
- Don't bother with the sword, go to the volcano and pick up the fire, pick up the little friend there too and kill them.
- You can kill the goblin, the ogre, the dragon, and the sandworm, but it isn't necessary to win the game, you'll just get more points.
- Drop the fire somewhere along the way to the cave.
- In the cave, pick up the amulet, it only works against the king
- Go to the castle and attack the king. He will die and you will win the game.
